## How does React work?

React creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a `diffing` algorithm, which identifies what has changed in the virtual DOM. The second step is `reconciliation`, where it updates the DOM with the results of the difference.

## What are React Hooks?

Hooks are a new addition to React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.

## What is Context API in ReactJS?

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

## Preserving and resetting state

Same component at the same position preserves state
eg:
{isFancy ? <Counter isFancy={true} />:
<Counter isFancy={false} />}
if the states were decalred in the counter comp it will be preserved eventhough if we change isFancy state . bcos -- Same component at the same position(itâ€™s the position in the UI treeâ€”not in the JSX markup) preserves state

go with the below doc ðŸ‘Œ
`https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state#same-component-at-the-same-position-preserves-state`

## There are two ways to reset state when switching between them:

Render components in different positions
Give each component an explicit identity with key

## Code Splitting - React.lazy();
